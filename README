This repository contains my programming projects using different data
structures including linked lists, graphs, arrays, and binary search trees.
The first project involves sorting arrays using the shell sort algorithm
The second project is similar to the first one except it sorts linked lists
using shell sort.
The third and fourth project packages transitors in an efficent 
manner and is solved using BST's.
The fifth project uses a graph algorithm to determine the longest commom subsequence in a genome 
The sixth project uses dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path 
across a river.
